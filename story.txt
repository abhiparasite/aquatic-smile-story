A kind-hearted street urchin Aladdin vies for the love of the beautiful princess Jasmine, the princess of Agrabah. When he finds a magic lamp, he uses a genie's magic power to make himself a prince in order to marry her. He is also on a mission to stop the powerful Jafar who plots to steal the magic lamp that could make his deepest wishes come true.


 Jafar is a really mean person. No one likes Jafar. He is mean. Some say that Jafar likes to be mean to kittens. What a jerk. Sometimes Jafar drops garbage in lecture hall and doesn't pick it up. He also doesn't cover his mouth when he sneezes.
